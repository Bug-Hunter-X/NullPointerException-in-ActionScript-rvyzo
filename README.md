This repository demonstrates a common error in ActionScript: attempting to access a property of a potentially null object.  The `bug.as` file contains the erroneous code, which throws a `NullPointerException`. The `bugSolution.as` file shows the corrected code with proper null checks.  This example highlights the importance of defensive programming in ActionScript to prevent runtime exceptions.
